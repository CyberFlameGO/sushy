This site is running on a [Python][p]-based CMS/Wiki called [Sushy][s].

It supports [Textile][t], [Markdown][m] and plain [HTML][h] as markup, has magical inter-page linking, full-text indexing and searching, extensive syntax highlighting support for source code and technical docs, and generally avoids breaking your content by default.
